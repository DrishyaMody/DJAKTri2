        <tr>
            <td>Question asking</td>
            <td>Users will be given the opportunity to ask questions regarding certain academic topics/subjects. These questions may be about upcoming tests, studying for AP exams, and where to find tutorials for concepts in their classes.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Commenting</td>
            <td>Users can comment on other users' questions. This may include elaborating on the question or giving their own personal insight to give a response from peer to peer.

        <tr>
            <td>Search</td>
            <td>Users can search for certain subjects they are wondering about to see the feedback others have gotten while asking similar questions. Searching key words will prompt questions that have similar subjects.</td>

            <td>Updating User Info</td>
            <td>Users will be able to manually update their own information. This can support students that may go by certain names or have nicknames they adopt later into having their account, creating an inclusive environment for students to feel safe in.</td>
